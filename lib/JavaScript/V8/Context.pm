=head1 NAME

JavaScript::V8::Context - An object in which we can execute JavaScript

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JavaScript::V8;

  # Create a runtime and a context
  my $context = JavaScript::V8::Context->new();

  # Add a function which we can call from JavaScript
  $context->bind_function(print => sub { print @_ });

  my $result = $context->eval($source);

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item new ( [time_limit => seconds], [enable_blessing => bool], [bless_prefix => string] )

Create a new JavaScript::V8::Context object. The optional C<time_limit>
parameter will force an exception after the script has run for a number of
seconds; this limit will be enforced even if V8 calls back to Perl or blocks on
IO.

If C<enable_blessing> is defined, JavaScript objects that have the
C<__perlPackage> prorerty are converted to Perl blessed scalar references.
These refernces are blessed into a Perl package with a name C<bless_prefix> +
C<__perlPackage>. This package is automagically created and filled with methods
from JavaScript object prototype. C<bless_prefix> is optional and can be left
out if you completely trust your JavaScript code.

=item bind ( name => $scalar )

Converts the given scalar value (array ref, code ref, or hash ref) to a v8
value and binds it in this execution context.

Examples:

=over

=item Functions

Pass the bind method the name of a function, and a corresponding code
reference to have the name bound to the Perl code. For example:

  $context->bind(hello => sub { print shift, "\n" });
  $context->eval("hello('Hello from JavaScript')");

=item Basic objects

Pass the bind method the name of an object, and a hash reference containing
method names and corresponding code references, for example:

  $context->bind(
    test_object => {
      method => sub { return shift },
    },
  );

  print $context->eval("test_object.method('Hello')");

=item Arrays

Pass the bind method a JavaScript variable name with an array reference to
have the name bound to the Perl array reference. Note that this binding is
one way; JavaScript can access Perl arrays and manipulate them, but changes
are not made available to the calling Perl code. Similarly, a JavaScript
array cannot be manipulated directly in Perl. Example:

  my $test_array_ref = ["hello"];

  $context->bind(
    test_array => $test_array_ref,
  );

  print $context->eval("test_array.pop()");

Calling the JavaScript pop method does not alter C<$test_array_ref> in
Perl.

=item Hashes

Pass the bind method a JavaScript variable name with a hash reference to
have the name bound to the Perl hash reference. For example:

  $context->bind(
    window => {
      location => "http://perl.org",
    },
  );

  print $context->eval("window.location");

This creates the "window.location" property in JavaScript. Properties can
be changed in JavaScript, but do not change the corresponding Perl data
structure.

=back

The exact semantics of this interface are subject to change in a future
version (the binding may become more complete).

=item bind_function ( $name => $subroutine_ref )

DEPRECATED. This is just an alias for bind.

=item eval ( $source )

Evaluates the JavaScript code given in I<$source> and
returns the result from the last statement.

C<JavaScript::V8> attempts to convert the return value to the corresponding
Perl type:

    JavaScript return type    |   Type returned by eval()
  ----------------------------+----------------------------
  Undefined, null             | undef
  Numeric                     | scalar
  Boolean                     | scalar (1 or 0)
  String                      | scalar
  Function                    | code reference
  Object                      | hash reference or blessed scalar reference
  Array                       | array reference

If there is a compilation error (such as a syntax error) or an uncaught
exception is thrown in JavaScript, this method returns undef and $@ is set.

A function reference returned from JavaScript is not wrapped in the context
created by eval(), so JavaScript exceptions will propagate to Perl code.
